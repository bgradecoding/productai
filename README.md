# Claude Web Generator

This project is a web application generator powered by Claude. It allows users to generate web components and wireframes based on their input.

## Project Structure

- `src/App.tsx`: Main application component.
- `src/components/ComponentPalette.tsx`: Defines the palette of available components.
- `src/components/WireframeCanvas.tsx`: Renders the generated wireframe.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm or yarn

2. Install dependencies:
